Hello,

my name is Gerrit Bickendorf and I am a german theoretical physicist. At the moment I am a doctoral student at the University of Bonn. For more than 15 years I have been interested in solving problems with computers which is why I made it my profession. My research interest is the intersection of modern machine learning and high-energy particle physics.

On this page I present my journey to where I am now and try to explain why machine learning is immensely useful in physics. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
